These tests exercise the various types of connections
generated by the AADL translator.

- testdpmon  : simple data port monitor
- testepmon  : simple event port monitor
- testevent  : simple seL4 notifications
- testshare  : simple shared memory connection
- testsubprogram : simple subprogram access and seL4 RPC (TBD)

Each test directory includes

- Its source AADL model (*.aadl),
- A `behavior_code` directory that contains the component behavior code that is inserted into the generated CAmkES,
- A `CAmkES` directory that contains the source code for the CAmkES application generated from the AADL model by the KSU ACT tool.
