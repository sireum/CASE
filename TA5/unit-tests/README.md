Connection Tests
================

These tests exercise the various types of connections
generated by the AADL translator.

- testevent  : simple seL4 notifications
- testdpmon  : simple data port monitor
- testshare  : simple shared memory connection
- testepmon  : TODO simple event port monitor

They are currently configured to use the ia32 platform,
though this will change to an ARM platform soon.

Setup
-----

Tests assume CAmkES 3.5.0 is installed on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) x86_64
or similar Linux distribution.  Initialize your host and the
`camkes-project/` directory per directions at
https://docs.sel4.systems/CAmkES/

Symbolically link the tests of interest into your 
`camkes-project/` directory, for example, to link all tests:

    CTESTS=/home/MYSELF/projects/case/conntests
    cd ~/camkes-project
    ln -s ${CTESTS}/*.sh
    ln -s ${CTESTS}/projects/camkes/apps/* projects/camkes/apps/

Basic Usage
===========

Invoke a script `install-<SOMETEST>.sh` to prepare the build directory.

Enter the build directory just created, and invoke "ninja".
This will take a while.

Run the `./simulate` script to see the results via QEMU.

Exit QEMU console by typing: Ctrl-a x
