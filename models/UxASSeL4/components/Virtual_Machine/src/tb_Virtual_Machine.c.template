  ***AUTOGENERATED CODE: DO NOT MODIFY***

This C file contains the implementations of the AADL primitives
used by user-level declarations for thread Virtual_Machine.

The user code runs in terms of "dispatchers", which cause
dispatch user-level handlers to execute.  These handlers can
communicate using the standard AADL primitives, which are mapped
to C functions.

The send/receive handlers are not thread safe in CAmkES; it is
assumed that this is handled by the CAmkES sequentialized access
to the dispatch handler.  There is only one dispatch interface
for the component containing all of the dispatch points.

They are thread safe for eChronos.

The read/write handlers are thread safe because the writer comes
through a dispatch interface but the reader is "local" on a dispatch
interface and so contention may occur.
